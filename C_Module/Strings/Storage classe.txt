compiler translates source code file written in c to machine language
a program is constituted b the set of translation


A global variable declared without storage class has external linkage--(any where in program scope)
A global variable declared with static storage class has internal linkage--(only in file scope)
Local variable has no linkage
variable declaration with "extern" - in such case linkage to be determined by refeering to pvp.

if no previously visible declaration (pvp) then external linkage
if previously visible declaration (pvp) is a local variable then external linkage
if previously visible declaration (pvp) is a global variable then linkage is same as of global variable.


compilation error if there is linkage disagreement

multiple tentative definition print 1 and looks for previously visible declaration

if pvp is a local variable then it has extrenal linkage

if extern and initializer not permitted in block scope it shows invalid
